      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>We are pretty pleased with this project. We completed the project with a bit of time to spare though that's 
        not without annoying debugging of both the hardware and software variety. We still have some bugs that we didn't 
        have time to get through such as the fast RC (roman cancel) combos not between inputted correctly. Fast RC
        are explained in the appendix. We think that the PIC32 controller doesn't record it fast enough and therefore 
        it doesn't record the RC in time. However, we didn't have enough time to figure it out. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This device actually conform to the applicable standard which the controller can be used in gameplay. Since all the 
        hardware and software are within the controller, then a person can cheat with the controller as an anti-anti cheat device. Most
        anti-cheat software tries to detect if the player are using some sort of software to like increase their health 
        or to give unlimited bar. However, the controller only allows the player to cheat only with recording combos beforehand and 
        then playback during the match. Another thing to improve our design is related to these anti-cheat software. We can imagined 
        that there's some anti-cheat software that will detect if the player uses the combo with the same timing as before and will flag 
        the player. To beat that anti-cheat software in particular, we can probably vary the timing of the combo from the PIC32. Then 
        the anti-anti-cheat hardware will be actually undetectable. I would not recommend though bringing this controller to a in-person 
        tournament since people can see your buttons though. However, play away with this controller in a online tournament! 
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to an anti-anti-cheat device for all types of players, it can also be used as an accessibility device as long 
        they have another person to actual input the combo at first. Some people might not be able to do certain combos due to disabilities.
        Our controller, as long someone else input the combo, will let the person play the combo with only a tap of a button, letting them 
        use the hardest combos with ease. 
      </p>
      <h3>Intellectual Property Considerations</h3>
      <p>We did reuse some of the code used in this class, however, most of the software was designed on our own. We did have 
        to reverse engineered a bit of the controller to understand how the controller get the inputs from the buttons and 
        the joystick. We opened the inside to see it as seen in Figure 1 below. We didn't get permission techincally from the 
        company to open up the controller. However, the controller manufacturers know that the fighting community does mod their 
        joystick controller, and therefore it's expected that the joystick controller will be opened at some point. 
        As such, We don't expect it to become too much of a problem not getting permission.

      <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
      <p>Though our design does promote cheating which is unethical in it's own sense, it doesn't hurt or exclude anyone which the
        IEEE Code of Ethics deals with. 
      </p>
      <h3>Safety Considerations</h3>
      <p>There's none that we can really think of unless the user is stupid.</p>
      <h3>Legal Considerations</h3>
      <p>The only additional hardware/software that we used is the controller which was explained in the Intellectual
        Property Considerations.
